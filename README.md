# MyStore Project Overview

MyStore is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process. 

## Getting Started

To set up the application, the dependencies must first be installed by running:
> `npm install`

After installing the dependencies run:
> `npm start`

Then, open any of the following address from any web browser:
> http://localhost:4200

OR
> http://127.0.0.1:4200

## Project Instructions

#### Project introduction: MyStore

You've completed the course! You know how to create a single-page application to offer a rich, dynamic experience on the web.

To showcase your new skills, you'll build an e-commerce website â€“ an application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process. 

#### Starter code

The Angular CLI allows was helpful to quickly scaffold a new application, as well as generate all necessary components, services, and modules. While you'll use the CLI to create a new application from scratch, I also used  some code and data provided:

* `data.json`. I used the [data.json](./src/assets/data.json) for fetching the products data.

#### Project features

The application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

* **Product list** page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
* **Product details** page, which displays more information about any particular product
* **Shopping cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
* **Checkout form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
* **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
